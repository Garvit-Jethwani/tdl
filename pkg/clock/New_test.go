Scenario 1: Successful Creation of Clock with Default Host

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function successfully creates a clock with the default host when no host is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as we won't be providing any NTP host.
  Act: Invoke the New function with no parameters.
  Assert: Assume the default host is correct and never down, so the function should return a clock instance without any error.

Validation:
  The main assertion here is that no error is returned. The validity of the default host and therefore the success of this operation is assumed. This test ensures the function behaves correctly when no host is provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 2: Successful Creation of Clock with Provided Host

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function successfully creates a clock with a provided host.

Execution:
  Arrange: An NTP host string needs to be arranged for this test.
  Act: Invoke the New function with the arranged host string as a parameter.
  Assert: If the provided host string is correct and the host is not down, the function should return a clock instance without any error.

Validation:
  The main assertion here is that no error is returned when a valid host is provided. The function should successfully create a clock instance with the provided NTP host. This test addresses the normal operation of the function when a single host parameter is provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 3: Attempt to Create Clock with Multiple Hosts

Details:
  Description: This test verifies if the function correctly handles a situation where more than one NTP host is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Arrange two different NTP host strings for this test.
  Act: Invoke the New function with the two arranged host strings as parameters.
  Assert: The function should return an error indicating "too many ntp hosts".

Validation:
  The assertion here is that an error is returned when more than one host is provided. According to the specific functionality of the function, it must return an error when multiple NTP hosts are provided. This test verifies the function's error handling in such a state.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 4: Attempt to Create Clock with Invalid Host 

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the function correctly handles a scenario where an invalid NTP host is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Arrange an invalid NTP host string for this test.
  Act: Invoke the New function with the arranged invalid host string as a parameter.
  Assert: The function should return an error indicating that it could not query the host.

Validation:
  The assertion here is that an error is returned when an invalid host is provided. This test verifies the function's error handling when it encounters an invalid or inaccessible host. This also shows how the function deals with unexpected inputs, helping to ensure the robustness of the application.
