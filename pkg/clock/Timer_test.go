Scenario 1: Verify that the method Timer returns a valid clock.Timer
- Details:
    - Description: This test is intended to verify that the called Timer function returns a valid clock.Timer object. The test will check if the return type and timer are non-nil and meet the expectations.
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Instantiate a new instance of networkClock with a sensible time duration as offset.
    - Act: Call the Timer function on the networkClock instance and store the result.
    - Assert: Use Go test assertions to check that the returned timer is not nil and is instance of Timer.
- Validation:
    - The test asserts the correct functionality of the Timer method, ensuring it correctly returns a clock.Timer.
    - This test is vital as it covers the normal behavior of the Timer function, confirming it works as intended.

Scenario 2: Verify the timing value of the sheduled timer
- Details:
    - Description: This test is meant to confirm the scheduled timer is set to the appropriate timing value. The scenario invokes the Timer function with a timed duration and validates that the returned timer is indeed set to the specified duration.
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Initiate an instance of networkClock with a reasonable time duration as offset.
    - Act: Invoke the Timer function on the networkClock instance with a particular duration. Record the instant before and after invocation.
    - Assert: Calculate the difference between the before and after time instance. Substract the offset and compare it with the duration - they must be equal.
- Validation:
    - The test verifies that the timing value of the Timer method is set properly. It supports the assumption that the timer is correctly set and works as programmed.  
    - This test ensures the accuracy of the timer, which is critical in time-sensitive applications.

Scenario 3: Negative Test - Verify that the method Timer handles zero duration
- Details:
    - Description: This test is designed to check how the Timer method handles a timer duration of zero. We should expect an immediate timer.
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Instantiate a new instance of networkClock.
    - Act: Invoke the Timer method on the networkClock instance, passing zero as duration.
    - Assert: Check whether the returned timer ticks immediately or has a duration of zero.
- Validation:
    - The test's assertion confirms the Timer method behaves as expected in an edge case where a timer duration of zero is passed to it.
    - This test is integral to ensure the program handles edge cases predictably and gracefully. 

Scenario 4: Negative Test - Verify that the Timer method handles negative duration
- Details:
    - Description: This test is developed to understand how the Timer function behaves when it receives a negative duration. The expected behavior would be the timer ticking immediately.
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Create a new instance of networkClock.
    - Act: Invoke the Timer method on the networkClock instance, passing in a negative duration.
    - Assert: Use Go test assertions to verify whether the returned timer ticks immediately or has a duration of zero.
- Validation:
    - The assertion confirms how well the Timer method deals with the edge case when a negative timer duration is provided.
    - This test can expose bugs or unexpected behavior arising from edge scenarios in application usage.
