```go
Scenario 1: Successful Initialization of Timer

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to validate the timer's successful creation, given a valid duration.
Execution:
    Arrange: A function invocation is set with a specific duration, e.g., time.Second.
    Act: The `Timer` function is invoked with this duration.
    Assert: Assert that the returned timer is not nil, and its runtime type is time.Timer.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion validates that the function has returned a valid Timer object. However, since we cannot control the system clock in a deterministic way, we cannot predict and validate the time the returned timer will fire. This test is important as it ensures that the function under test correctly initializes a timer.

Scenario 2: Duration set to Zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to ensure the timer behaves correctly given a zero duration; in Go std library, time.NewTimer with zero duration returns a timer that has already expired.
Execution:
    Arrange: Function invocation is set with zero duration.
    Act: The `Timer` function is invoked.
    Assert: Check that the returned Timer object has already expired.
Validation:
    Asserting that the Timer has already expired checks that the `Timer` function behaves consistently with time.NewTimer from Go std library.

Scenario 3: Negative Duration

Details:
    Description: This test is intended to ensure that the timer behaves as expected when given a negative duration; according to the Go std library, time.NewTimer with a negative duration behaves similarly as a zero duration and returns an expired timer.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set function invocation with negative duration.
    Act: The `Timer` function is invoked.
    Assert: Check that the returned Timer object has already expired.
Validation:
    Checking to see if the Timer has already expired validates that the `Timer` function behaves consistently with the time.NewTimer from the Go std library when a negative duration is provided.

Notice: 
In the test scenarios provided above, we assume the Timer method is implemented to behave consistently with time.NewTimer from Go standard library. In a real-world scenario, if we structured the project to have an interface for the clock and utilised dependency injection, we could mock the clock interface in our tests, allowing us more options for testing different scenarios.
